              <p>This was a story of our first date.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>It was a beautiful moment, but one of mixed feelings. Looking out our pod, I see a breathtaking view of the 1950-esque theme park, glittering with shimmering lights and joyous faces. As we reach the top of the ferris wheel, we're privileged with a brief but scenic view of Sydney's iconic coastal skyline, the Harbour Bridge and Opera House framed in a perfect shot.</p>

              <p>She sits beside me, recollecting our day - ice skating, hot chocolates and a heaping load of banter. Gesturing at the changing colourful lights of the ferris wheel, she tells me how beautiful she thinks this ride is, not knowing that I was fixated on the two clowns below us, looming around on stilts, now ironically looking like little ants.</p>

              <p>I turn to face her, looking at her curiously, trying to remember what was it she just told me. I hold her gaze for a moment and smile "Very beautiful". She was.</p>

              <p>The ferris wheel makes a sudden stop, to allow more passengers into the other pods. We're both now suspended in mid-air, alone and in close proximity. I slowly lean away from her as I notice how strange this feels. This was not supposed to be a date. We joked all day about how she had turned down many guys who started off as friends but eventually developed feelings for her. I didn't want to be one of those guys, but I was.</p>

              <p>I scramble to make a joke, because jokes just make everything better.</p>

              <p>"Hey, wouldn't it be funny if I put my arm around you now, and tussle your hair?" making a reference to a story she had told me today, where her friend did just that as an awkward attempt to flirt with her. She turned him down soon after.</p>

              <p>"Are you going to tell me we need to stop hanging out?" I say with sly confidence, despite my hand freezing in hesitation right before her shoulder. This is probably not the best joke to make. I let out a chuckle but racing through my mind are nervous thoughts of whether actually placing my arm around her will lead to me receiving the same treatment as the other guy. I decided not to find out so I lean my arm on the seat rest behind her, a safe and respectful distance, in the friend zone.</p>

              <p>I truly did enjoy her company today. We are great as friends, and that is something I am not prepared to risk. When I think about it, all I really want is to spend more time with her and have good conversations. Friends can do that.</p>

              <p>She tells me this ride would have been romantic if she could have done it with a boyfriend. "Yeah, it is a romantic ride. Maybe next time" I say.</p>

              <p>The ferris wheel slows before coming to another halt and the conductor opens the door to our pod.</p>

              <p>She walks out, and I follow after her from behind, <i>as a good friend and nothing more</i>.</p>
