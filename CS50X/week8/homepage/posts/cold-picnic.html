            <p>An actually <i>planned</i> date.</p>
              <hr>
            <p>The sun finally sets, revealing a deep purple, cloudless sky. A cold wind blows, rustling the leaves of the tree directly above us. She bursts out in laughter once again to a teasing joke she makes at my expense, this time revealing the sight of her upper teeth. The chemistry is going great.</p>

            <p>"You can lie down if you want to" I say, noticing how she keeps falling back onto the picnic blanket but awkwardly gets back up when she realises she's lying down.</p>

            <p>"Oh no, I'm fine. I like sitting up"</p>

            <p>"If that's the case, I'll lie down first so it's going to be weird for you to be sitting up"</p>

            <p>She lies down next to me. For a few moments, we stare at the empty night sky in peaceful silence.</p>

            <p>She turns to me "I'm still not sure about this. I like you, I really do. I just can't help but worry how this feels a bit weird."</p>

            <p>"Well, tell me how you think it's weird" we have developed an honest kind of openness on talking about our feelings today. We openly shared how we felt about each other, our worries in where this date would take us, and even the weird things we tend to over think about.</p>

            <p>"I'm not sure. I guess I can't help but feel the friend vibe with you. Maybe it's because I'm usually different with the guys I date."</p>

            <p>"Thats funny, I kind of feel the same way. If we do just end up as friends, I've got no regrets though."</p>

            <p>She smiles at that statement. "Me too".</p>

            <p>I reflect on our day. We had such a great time. There were some subtle date-like moments. I love how we both cooked for two people but ended up with too much food that I ended up eating her Thai coconut lemongrass chicken, while she ate my lasagne, both of us not having room for the portions we cooked for ourselves.</p>

            <p>I guess the way we were so transparent with each other made our conversations feel very logical and less mysterious, different from the typical conversation on a first date. Maybe this was the kind of romance I liked, talking about complex philosophical issues on a cold winter picnic.</p>

            <p>I notice I've been thinking in silence too long. I look over to her once again. She's lying down staring at the tree above us, clearly with a lot on her mind as well.</p>

            <p>"What are you over thinking about?" I ask her with a mischievous grin.</p>

            <p>"Just about how we.... Oh shit, it's late. Do you still have Zoom on your phone? I need to get ready for the video call with my founder. Do you mind holding up a light during the call so it's not too dark?"</p>

            <p><i>"Anything you need".</i></p>
