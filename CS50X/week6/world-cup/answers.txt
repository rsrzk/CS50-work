Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, I assumed that the time would increase proportionally to the increase in number of simulations. But turns out, only the increase in time grew proportionally.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10,000 simulations whereby most of the simulation results was unchanged beyond that size N.
